PostSnippet: My first smaller game review of the game Overwatch 2! Does it live up to the hype? Was there even hype around Overwatch 2? Did we even ask for an Overwatch 2? Wow I said Overwatch 2 a lot!

## General

This game should be called overwatch 1.5. Pretty much the same thing, just threw a fresh coat of paint on it and added two characters. It's pretty much the same thing, and plays the same. Maps are the same. 95% of characters are the same.

## Gameplay

Game play feels pretty similar to 1. Games are 5v5, 1 tank, 2 attack, 2 support. This makes support get pooped on... Support feels a lot harder to me now due to the one less tank option. You are left open a lot more to the attack roles. Maybe this change is to quicken games? Having one tank makes the tank pick very critical to the team. The tank pick will make or break your team.. so match up with a bad tank player and your match is already over before it starts.

## New characters

They are cool.. I guess... Junker Queen tank is cooler then the new support though... Not much to say here haha..

## Engine

Game still feels really good. One of the best fps engines around. Very very easy to max fps with max graphics on this game. And now they added three graphics options that are a huge win to the gaming community

- Dynamic resolution scaling - scales your game resolution based on your target framerate; allowing you to always hit your target framerate at the cost of some resolution %
- Dlss (Nvidia) - AI upscaling
- Fsr 1.0 (AMD) - AI upscaling

These options let you meet your target frame rate at minimum graphic performance loss. More games need to be using these options; big wins for high resolutions and frame rates.
Again though... I have a 6900xt and I am easily hitting 170fps at 1440p at 100% resolution scale, without the need of any AI upscaling technology. This is a testament to the power of the 6900xt (which is godly) but also the Overwatch game engine is next-level-good. In the highest most intense moments in the game I don't even drop 1fps.
And now if you don't have the luxury of a $700+ GPU you can hit these frame rates too with good AI upscaling technology... Good job Bill Gates.

## Overall

If this was Overwatch 1.5, then 8/10, gg glhf kid; what a great update to the game. But this is Overwatch 2... And I am sitting here playing this game... thinking... what's different then the game I have been playing for years now... And now if I want cool cosmetics I have to pay for a battle pass... WHAT! 6/10.. still like the game though!
